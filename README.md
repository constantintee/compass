# Compass ðŸ§­

A full-stack dockerized stock prediction system leveraging machine learning to forecast market trends.

## Overview

**Compass** is a comprehensive, full-stack application designed to predict stock prices using advanced machine learning algorithms, based on the Elliot-Wave-Theory. The project is fully dockerized, separating concerns into individual containers for streamlined development and deployment. It leverages a PostgreSQL database enhanced with TimescaleDB for efficient time-series data management. The goal is to make stock prdictions good and open-source. I'm not a programmer by any means. I've done all of that with AI (which I'm not so proud about. It's like working with a very smart baby....). I apprichiate any help to keep this project moving forward. 

## Architecture

The application is divided into five main steps:

- **Downloader**: Handles the acquisition of historical stock data
- **Preprocessor**: Cleans and transforms raw data for ML pipeline
- **Training**: Executes machine learning model training
- **Backend**: Manages API endpoints and business logic
- **Frontend**: Provides user interface and data visualization
